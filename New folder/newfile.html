     <p>The series "How to Get Away with Murder" follows Annalise Keating, a brilliant but notorious criminal defense attorney and university professor, who selects five of her law students (the "Keating 5") to assist on her high-profile cases, only for them to become entangled in actual murders they must conceal and get away with. The show is known for its non-linear storytelling, using flashbacks and flash-forwards to build suspense as the students try to cover their tracks, navigate their personal lives, and maintain their innocence, often resorting to increasingly complex and morally ambiguous schemes to hide the truth. </p>
